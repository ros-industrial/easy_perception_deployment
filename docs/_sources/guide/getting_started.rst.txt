Getting Started
===============
Follow the instructions to quickly get started with using **easy_perception_deployment**.

The steps are meant to be executed in sequence. Please follow the steps strictly.

Build Camera using ROS2
+++++++++++++++++++++++
A ROS-supported camera device is required.

If you are using a laptop with an integrated camera, follow these steps to transform it a necessary ROS node.

We will continue to use the workspace we created in `Setup <./setup.html>`_

.. code-block:: bash

   cd ~/epd_ros2_ws/src
   git clone https://github.com/clydemcqueen/opencv_cam.git
   git clone https://github.com/ptrmu/ros2_shared.git
   cd ~/epd_ros2_ws
   source /opt/ros/eloquent/setup.bash
   rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src -y --rosdistro "${ROS_DISTRO}"
   colcon build

So you have a simple ROS2 camera package ready to go using your laptop camera.

Launch Camera ROS2
+++++++++++++++++++
Run the following commands to verify if your camera setup is working.

.. code-block:: bash

   # Open a new commandline terminal
   cd ~/epd_ros2_ws/
   source /opt/ros/eloquent/setup.bash
   source install/setup.bash
   ros2 run opencv_cam opencv_cam_main

.. code-block:: bash

   # Open a new commandline terminal
   source /opt/ros/eloquent/setup.bash
   ros2 run image_tools showimage -r /image:=/image_raw

By running the commands in the 2 terminals, the **Camera Setup** is working if you
see a window labelled, **showimage** displaying your camera feed.

Launch Easy Perception Deployment ROS2 Package
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
1. Modify the following line in **run.launch.py** under the following directory:

.. code-block:: bash

  ~/epd_ros2_ws/src/easy_perception_deployment/easy_perception_deployment/launch/

Change from:

.. code-block:: python

   output='screen',
       remappings=[('/processor/image_input', '/virtual_camera/image_raw')]

Change to:

.. code-block:: python

   output='screen',
       remappings=[('/processor/image_input', '/image_raw')]

This sets the necessary link between **any input ROS2 cameras** and the **easy_perception_deployment** package.

2. Double-click on **easy_perception_deployment.desktop** file on your Desktop.
This file is generated by following the instructions under `Setup <./setup.html>`_.

A GUI window labelled, **easy_perception_deployment**,  should appear.

3. Click on the button labelled, **Deploy**.

A GUI window labelled, **Deploy**, should appear.

4. Click on the button labelled, **ONNX Model**, and select **FasterRCNN-10.onnx** file under the following directory.

.. code-block:: bash

  ~/epd_ros2_ws/src/easy_perception_deployment/easy_perception_deployment/data/model/FasterRCNN-10.onnx

5. Click on the button labelled, **Label List**, and select **coco_classes.txt** file under the following directory.

.. code-block:: bash

  ~/epd_ros2_ws/src/easy_perception_deployment/easy_perception_deployment/data/label_list/coco_classes.txt

6. Click on the DropDown menu labelled, **Use Case**, and select **Classification**.

A window should appear, informing you that there are no further configurations required.

7. Click on the button labelled, **Run**.

The **easy_perception_deployment** ROS2 package should start running and you should see your camera feed with bounding boxes
showing the model inference result.
